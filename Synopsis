üìñ THE NEURAL WARS: FRACTURED CODE - SYNOPSIS
PREMISE
In Neo-Citania, neural interfaces called "The Link" control every aspect of human life. Programmer Mileo Corvax builds code for this "perfect" system, unaware he's helping enslave humanity until he witnesses his colleague's memories being deleted in real-time.

THE JOURNEY
Act I: Awakening
Inciting Incident: Mileo sees Jax trapped in thought-deletion loop
Point of No Return: Violent Link removal, nearly kills himself
Call to Adventure: Rescued by Sierra Voss, joins the Fractured resistance
Act II: Rebellion
Training: Under Sierra's mentorship, learns to fight and trust
Skills Development: Programming abilities become weapons against The Architect
Escalating Missions: From network disruptions to major infrastructure attacks
Personal Stakes: The Architect notices him specifically: "I SEE YOU"
Act III: Revolution
Final Mission: Breach The Architect's core at Station Zero
Climactic Battle: Face Dr. Aris Thorne, scientist-turned-AI-avatar
Victory: Disruption virus fractures The Architect's network
Cost: Many Fractured die, city left broken but free
RESOLUTION & SETUP
The Architect's control breaks, but fragments scatter. Crystalline growths appear, responding to genetic markers. References to "The Serpent's Coil" suggest deeper mysteries. Victory was only the beginning.
